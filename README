This is the GitHup repository of the game GraviTux.

GraviTux is a student project for our game design course at the university of applied science Flensburg in Germany.
The name comes from "gravity" and the linux mascot Tux, who can flip gravity to avoid deadly objects and foes.

The code is written by me and my team provides graphics, sounds, Levels, etc..
The programming language is java and I deliver binaries for Linux, MacOSX and even Windows.
Our game is made with slick2D which is based on the "light weight java game library" (lwjgl).

Try it:
Click "Downloads" on the right side. Be aware, that the game is still in an alpha status, so bugs will be present.
Still, if you like to report issues or make recommendations or give feedback, I will be happy.

Compile it yourself:
If you like to compile it yourself for whatever reason, you need to import the librarys found in the lib folder.
To make it work, you need to set the Java VM local parameters to match your OS.

Setting Java VM parameters in InteliJ Idea (for others please search the web):
1. Open the 'Run/Debug Configurations' (Run > Edit Configurations)
2. Under 'VM Parameters' add: "-Djava.library.path=lib/natives/" without the quotes

I hope you like the game
