This is the GitHup repository of the game GraviTux.

GraviTux is a student project for our game design course at the university of applied science Flensburg in Germany.
The name comes from "gravity" and the linux mascot Tux, who can flip gravity to avoid deadly objects and foes.

The code is written by me and my team provides graphics, sounds, Levels, etc..
The programming language is java and I deliver binaries for Linux, MacOSX and even Windows.
Our game is made with slick2D which is based on the "light weight java game library" (lwjgl).

I hope you like the game

greetings Lennart
